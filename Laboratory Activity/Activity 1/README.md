Overview

This laboratory activity demonstrates digital output control using an Arduino Uno by implementing a running light circuit. LEDs are turned ON and OFF sequentially to illustrate how digital signals and timing operate in embedded systems.

Objectives

Understand the use of Arduino as a basic device for IoT projects

Learn how to control digital output pins using Arduino

Hardware Used

Arduino Uno
5 LEDs
Resistors
Breadboard
Jumper wires
Implementation Details

LEDs are connected to digital pins 8 through 12
LEDs turn ON sequentially from pin 12 down to pin 8
After all LEDs are ON, they turn OFF in the same order
A 1-second delay is applied between each step for clear visibility
The setup() function initializes all LED pins as OUTPUT
The loop() function contains:
One loop to turn LEDs ON sequentially
One loop to turn LEDs OFF sequentially
